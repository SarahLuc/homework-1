# Code Refactor Starter Code
Deleted benefit lead margin bottom 32px 
because it was posted 3 times when we only needed it once 

changed the title from "website" to "horiseon" so the url in the browser will say the website title instead of just "website" 

got rid of the "#" in the href links because it was pointless 

put the footer "font-size" into the footer code instead of having it on its own. 

took out backround color.
body {
    background-color: #d9dcd6;
}

Changed div to nav on top
